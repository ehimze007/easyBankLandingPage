# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allows front end developers to improve their skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out the landing page which is in the design folder and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
